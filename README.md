# Haunted Castle mini game.

###### Project Overview

Project #3 of Udacity's [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). The task was to recreate the classic arcade game [Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger). I found the rules to be quite easy so I decided to go for different ones.

## Getting Started
### Brief Story
>You are a guinea pig that is adventuring in a haunted castle.
Your mission is to collect as many gems as you can and survive the attack of malevolent ghosts, but be careful, the castle was told to be haunted by the Old Dark King, who is going around the castle preventing their visitors to escape with the gems...
### How to play
>Use your arrow keys to move your guinea pig around the map.
Collect the gems, dodge the ghosts, survive!
